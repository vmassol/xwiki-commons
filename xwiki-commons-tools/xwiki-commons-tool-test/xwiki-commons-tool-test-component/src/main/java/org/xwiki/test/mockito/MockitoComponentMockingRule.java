/**
 * Unit tests for Components should extend this class instead of using {@link MockitoComponentManagerRule} or
 * {@link org.xwiki.test.ComponentManagerRule} which should only be used for integration tests.
 * <p>
 * To use this class, define a JUnit {@code @Rule} and pass the component implementation class that you wish to have
 * mocked for you. Then in your test code, do a lookup of your component under test and you'll get a component instance
 * which has all its injected dependencies mocked automatically.
 * <p>
 * For example:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * public class MyComponentTest
 * {
 *     &#64;Rule
 *     public final MockitoComponentMockingRule&lt;MyComponent&gt; mocker =
 *         new MockitoComponentMockingRule(MyImplementation.class);
 * 
 *     &#64;Test
 *     public void someTest() throws Exception
 *     {
 *         MyComponent myComponent = mocker.getComponentUnderTest();
 *         ...
 *     }
 * ...
 * }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Note that by default there are no component registered against the component manager except those mocked
 * automatically by the Rule (except for the MockitoComponentMockingRule itself, which means that if your component
 * under test is injected a default ComponentManager, it'll be the MockitoComponentMockingRule which will get injected.
 * See more below). This has 2 advantages:
 * <ul>
 * <li>This is the spirit of this Rule since it's for unit testing and this testing your component in isolation from the
 * rest</li>
 * <li>It makes the tests up to 10 times faster</li>
 * </ul>
 * If you really need to register some components, use the {@link org.xwiki.test.annotation.ComponentList} annotation
 * and if you really really need to register all components (it takes time) then use
 * {@link org.xwiki.test.annotation.AllComponents}.
 * <p>
 * In addition, you can perform some action before any component is registered in the Component Manager by having one or
 * several methods annotated with {@link org.xwiki.test.annotation.BeforeComponent}. Similarly, you can perform an
 * action after all components have been registered in the Component Manager by having one or several methods annotated
 * with {@link org.xwiki.test.annotation.AfterComponent}.
 * <p>
 * This can be useful (for example) in the case you wish to register a mock ComponentManager in your component under
 * test. You would write:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * &#64;Rule
 * public final MockitoComponentManagerRule mocker = new MockitoComponentManagerRule();
 * 
 * &#64;AfterComponent
 * public void overrideComponents() throws Exception
 * {
 *     this.mocker.registerMockComponent(ComponentManager.class);
 * }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * @param <T> the component role type, used to provide a typed instance when calling {@link #getComponentUnderTest()}
 * @version $Id$
 * @since 4.3.1
